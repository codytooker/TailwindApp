                            I love playing poker. I mostly play tournaments and
                            have been doing so for most of my adult life. I have
                            played in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas and
                            have cashed / won a few smaller tournaments. The

                            I currently have a 90 gallon saltwater aquarium and
                            am in the process of setting up a brand new 200
                            gallon system. Running a functioning reef system
                            involves solving tons of small problems and really

                            I have been playing disc golf for 15 years or so. It
                            is a great way to get outside and enjoy nature,
                            while challenging yourself to get better. Back in
                            2015 I started my own subscription box service for
                            disc golfers called Disc2Door. It was a fun project
                            that I ran for a about half the year before I
                            decided to focus on other things.
